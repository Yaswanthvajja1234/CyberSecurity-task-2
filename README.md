**CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP
Task 2: Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux &
Windows)
Name: Yaswanth Vajja
Organization: Elevate Labs
Internship: Cyber Security Internship
Date:16 January 2026**
1. Introduction to Operating System Security
Operating System security focuses on protecting the core system that manages users, processes,
memory, and hardware. A secure OS prevents unauthorized access, malware infections, and
misuse of system resources.
2. User Accounts and Access Control
User accounts and access control mechanisms ensure that users can access only authorized
resources. Permissions help prevent accidental or malicious actions that could compromise system
security.
3. File Permissions in Linux
Linux uses file permissions to control read, write, and execute access for owner, group, and others.
Commands like chmod, chown, and ls -l are used to manage and view these permissions.
4. Administrator vs Standard User
Administrators have complete system control, while standard users have limited privileges. Using
standard users for daily tasks reduces the risk of system-wide compromise.
5. Firewall Configuration
Firewalls protect systems by filtering network traffic. UFW is commonly used in Linux, while
Windows Defender Firewall is used in Windows environments.
6. Processes and Services Management
Monitoring running processes and disabling unnecessary services reduces the system attack
surface and improves security.
7. Operating System Hardening Practices
OS hardening includes applying updates, disabling unused services, enforcing strong passwords,
enabling firewalls, and using antivirus tools.
8. Conclusion
This task improved understanding of OS-level security concepts for Linux and Windows, helping
build a foundation for secure system administration.
